Below, I’ve broken down the previously categorized high-level user stories into smaller, actionable tasks for developers. Each task is assigned a story point based on your provided measurement scale:
	•	1: Less than an hour
	•	3: A few hours
	•	5: 1 day
	•	8: A few days
	•	13+: Longer (e.g., a week or more, though I’ll keep tasks small enough to avoid this where possible).
The breakdown ensures tasks are granular, independent (where feasible), and estimable, aligning with SCRUM principles. I’ve estimated points based on typical effort for a developer familiar with Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, and deployment tools like Heroku.

Notes on Estimation
	•	Assumptions: Estimates assume a developer with moderate experience in the tech stack (Node.js, React, Postgres, Heroku). Newer developers might need more time (e.g., 5 → 8 points).
	•	Dependencies: Some tasks depend on others (e.g., Task 2.3 needs 2.2), but I’ve kept them small and separable for sprint planning.
	•	Timeline Fit: With 99 points and ~11 weeks (April 15 - July 1, 2025), a team could aim for ~9 points per week, achievable with 1-2 developers working part-time or 1 full-time.

Next Steps
	•	Sprint Planning: I can suggest a 2-week sprint breakdown (e.g., Sprint 1: FE basics + BE setup, ~18 points).
	•	Refinement: Adjust points if you have a specific team size or skill level in mind.
	•	Prioritization: Let me know if you want certain tasks (e.g., payment integration) done first.
What would you like to do next? A sprint plan, point adjustments, or something else?
